# Telegram Repost Bot

This is a Telegram chat bot that can be used to identify people in group chats who spam or reshare the same content in a group channel. 

You can read more about Telegram's API and creating bots here: https://core.telegram.org/api.

The Repost Bot uses the Telegram API, Node.js, and the Node Telegram package.

## Getting Started

1. Download Telegram and open the application on your device. 
2. Perform a global search for the bot by typing "ReeepostBot" and add it to your contacts or your group.
3. When a user reposts the same content, call Repost Bot by typing "/repost users_name". Repost Bot will continuously scan messages until the keyword "/repost" is mentioned followed by the culprit's name. Then Repost Bot will send a message to the channel that includes the name of the culprit.
